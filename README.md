# nth Prime
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
